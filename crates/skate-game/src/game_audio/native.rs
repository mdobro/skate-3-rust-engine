//! Host for the native AEMS runtime (`crates/skate-audio`): retail's own patch programs and voice
//! graph. Always on (2026-10-03: the interim cue tables and their opt-outs `SKATE_AEMS=0` /
//! `"interim": true` are gone; docs/hails-additions/11-audio.md). An install without the data
//! (AEMS banks, MixMap, grain recordings, Splice trees) logs an error naming what is missing and
//! those sounds stay silent: there is no fallback.
//!
//! - At startup every Csis project is installed and `emitter_utility.abk` is loaded and posted
//!   (retail posts `c_emitter_utility` once at boot; it feeds the `*_snd` / `random_*_gbl` globals).
//! - Banks are loaded on first use, with their decoded WAVs as PCM, and unloaded on map change.
//! - One device-paced stream: rodio pulls 48 kHz stereo; each 256-frame block renders the voices
//!   and ticks the evaluator, so programs run on the audio clock exactly like retail. Game code
//!   posts, redelivers and releases between blocks under the runtime's lock.
//! - The stream follows the master volume (the AEMS voices × ambience, the rolling bed × effects)
//!   and pauses while the menu or a replay runs.
//! - The MixMap mixer (`MixMapSK8.mxb`, `skate_audio::mixmap`) runs on the game thread, clocked by
//!   the physics steps ([`HostClock`]: one host tick per step since the last frame, none while
//!   nothing steps or the game is silenced): [`mixmap_frame`] writes the inputs we can supply
//!   (category gains, the local player's physics and 3-D position, the emitter states' positions),
//!   ticks, and the systems read its outputs (the `c_emitter` words; the rolling bed's levels,
//!   pitch, filters and pan).
//!
//! Which systems use it: the skater's sounds (`player_audio.rs`), the `.ems` world emitters
//! (`emitters.rs`) and the granular rolling bed (`grain_bed.rs`). Location sets, zone beds and
//! crossfades still use interim Bevy playback; the zone fades and gains use native MixMap controls.
